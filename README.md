# AI Song Writer
<br>Always wondered what a love song written by AI would be like? <br>You finally have an answer!
By using a Long Short Term Memeory Neural Network, we were able to train our model on song lyrics from various artists
and create new songs in their style. After training and generating text, we run spell check using a dictionary of the artist's 
spelling.<br>*No robots were harmed in the making of this.*

We decided to combine popular singers known for writing love songs together to have enough training material as well as 
create interesting new styles. We are unable to upload the metrolyrics.csv file, but it can be obtained from kaggle in the 
following link. Simply update the link in the script generatelyrics.py and you can generate your very own music!
